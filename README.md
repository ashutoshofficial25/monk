## Tech Stack

This project was bootstrapped using **Vite** for an optimized development experience, fast build times, and an up-to-date module system.

---

## Features

- Drag-and-drop functionality for an intuitive user experience.
- Virtualized lists for optimized rendering of large datasets.
- API calls to fetch and display data dynamically.
- Clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.
